<h4>Abstract</h4>
Keyphrase extraction aims to select a set of terms from a document as a short summary. Most methods extract keyphrases according to their statistical properties in the given document. Appropriate keyphrases, however, are not always statistically significant or even have not appeared in the given document. This makes a large <i>vocabulary gap</i> between a document and its keyphrases. We consider that a document and its keyphrases are both describing the same object but written in two different languages. To address the problem, we regard keyphrase extraction as a problem of translating from the language of documents to the language of keyphrases. We use word alignment models in statistical machine translation to learn translation probabilities between the words in documents and the words in keyphrases. According to the translation model, we suggest keyphrases given a new document. The suggested keyphrases are not necessarily statistically frequent in the document, which indicates our method is more flexible and reliable. Experiments on news articles demonstrate that our method outperforms existing unsupervised methods on precision, recall and F-measure.
